# ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch
This is to document my journey to building ML algorithms from scratch!

Currently I am working on a Decision Tree from Scratch!

I will start implementing the following soon. 

1. Decision Tree + Random Forest from Scratch (In progress)

2. Linear Regression from Scratch

3. k-Nearest Neighbors from Scratch

4. Logistic Regression

5. Naive Bayes for Text Classification

6. k-Means Clustering
